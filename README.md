# Advent Of Code 2024

Advent of code is a yearly event of 25 day's of coding. This year you get two coding challenges each day which you have to complete to get stars. I personally find it a very fun even to follow along with and it can help you to explore a new language by figuring out how to do those coding challenges in the language you are trying to learn, or see if you really understand your current language of choice by completing them with that one.
