# Advent Of Code 2024

Advent of code is a yearly event of 25 day's of coding. You get two coding challenges each day which you have to complete to get stars, you "win" by having all 50 starts by the end of the challenge. I personally find it a very fun challenge to follow along with and it can help you to explore a new language by figuring out how to do these coding challenges in the language you are trying to learn, or see if you really understand your current language of choice by completing them with that one.

## Day 01

Day one was about location ID's, make lists of data from a text file and go through them to get your result.

## Day 02

Day two took way too long and I honestly felt like I should just give up on the entire challenge. Part two especially since I was overcomplicating way too many things.

## Day 03

Day three was quite enjoyable for me since I had been wanting to learn more about RegEx and practice it. After finding out how to do RegEx, things started going quite smooth.
